# ga_practice
practicing writing a genetic algorithm
the program will estimate the maximum f(x, y) value in a range through evolution
All of the GA scripts end in ga and have a python and bash component
The loop is ran by calling the bash script, which loops through the python program and writes the data to a csv file
The comparison between different GA scripts is run by iterations.sh
To run a comparison, simply input the names of the two scripts you wish to compare into iterations.sh
This script will run both GA's a set number of times. It will then output the average and maximum maximums as well as a scatter plot comparing the two.
